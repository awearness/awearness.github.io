<p>awearness is a simple wristband created during <a href="http://jugendhackt.de">JugendHackt</a> 2014 (a yearly hackathon for humans between 11 and 18 years in Berlin).</p>

<p>Actually it is quite simple: A 3d-printed wristband which connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth. The smartphone then is able to trigger the built-in vibration motor or LEDs of the wristband. The idea is to remind you or make you aware of certain things. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>a surveillance camera is nearby</li>
<li>you're in front of a supermarket and need to buy something</li>
<li>you're driving to fast</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="where-can-i-get-it" class="anchor" href="#where-can-i-get-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where can I get it?</h2>

<p>awearness is – as you might guess – an open-source wristband. You can find the code that was pushed while JugendHackt in <a href="https://github.com/jugendhackt/awearness">Jugendhackt/awearness</a>. We'll move the repositories to the awearness organization and push the missing code soon!</p>

<p>To have a real wristband you might want to print it yourself (note that the current design is not yet ready and not in the repo). Then you might want to get a <a href="http://rfduino.com">RFduino</a> and equip it with the <a href="https://github.com/Jugendhackt/awearness/blob/master/bluetooth-wristband/bluetooth-wristband.ino">firmware from the repo</a>. The corresponding Android-App is also not ready yet and there's (sadly) no iOS-Dev in our team (yet)</p>

<p>The wristband itself is 3d-printed what gives surprising good results.</p>
