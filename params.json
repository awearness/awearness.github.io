The smartphone then is able to trigger the built-in vibration motor or LEDs of the wristband. The idea is to remind you or make you aware of certain things. For example:\r\n\r\n* a surveillance camera is nearby\r\n* you're in front of a supermarket and need to buy something\r\n* you're driving to fast\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n## Where can I get it?\r\nawearness is – as you might guess – an open-source wristband. You can find the code that was pushed while JugendHackt in [Jugendhackt/awearness](https://github.com/jugendhackt/awearness). We'll move the repositories to the awearness organization and push the missing code soon!\r\n\r\nTo have a real wristband you might want to print it yourself (note that the current design is not yet ready and not in the repo). Then you might want to get a [RFduino](http://rfduino.com) and equip it with the [firmware from the repo](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/awearness/blob/master/bluetooth-wristband/bluetooth-wristband.ino). The corresponding Android-App is also not ready yet and there's (sadly) no iOS-Dev in our team (yet)\r\n\r\n## The wristband\r\nThe wristband itself is 3d-printed what gives surprising good results.\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of [the first prototype](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/awearness/commit/0d2273f3fde345a29f7bfb83331e38b4e3297423):\r\n\r\n![prototype](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxcrzJAIgAAa3A4.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Contact us!\r\nYou can contact us via our mailing list:\r\nawearness@lists.subsignal.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
