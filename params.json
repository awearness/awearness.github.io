{"name":"awearness","tagline":"a simple vibrating/flashing wristband to remind you!","body":"# awearness\r\n## What is awearness?\r\nawearness is a anwesome (at least we think it is) wristband created at the [JugendHackt](http://jugendhackt.de) Hackathon (an awesome Hackathon for humans between 11 and 18 years in Berlin).\r\n\r\nActually it is quite simple: It is a 3d-printed wristband which connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy. Then the smartphone is able to trigger a vibration or a blinking LED of the wristband. The Idea is to remind you of certain things and there are several ideas:\r\n\r\n* Vibration when a surveillance camera is nearby\r\n* Vibration when you're in front of a supermarket and need to buy something\r\n* Vibration when you're driving to fast with your car\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n## Where can I get it?\r\nawearness is – as you might guess – an open-source wristband. You can find the code that was pushed while JugendHackt in [Jugendhackt/awearness](https://github.com/jugendhackt/awearness). We'll move the repositories to the awearness organization and push the missing code soon!\r\n\r\n## The wristband\r\nThe wristband itself is 3d-printed what gives surprising good results.\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of [the first prototype](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/awearness/commit/0d2273f3fde345a29f7bfb83331e38b4e3297423):\r\n\r\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxcrzJAIgAAa3A4.jpg:large)\r\n\r\n## Contact us!\r\nYou can contact us via our mailing list:\r\nawearness@lists.subsignal.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
